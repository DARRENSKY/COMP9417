*** QUESTION 1
--- For this question "results" means the results you saved in "q1.out".

*** Question 1(a) [2 marks]
--- This question has two multiple-choice parts, each worth 1 mark.

*** Part 1:
--- Looking at the results for BOTH the Nearest Neighbour and
--- Decision Tree learning algorithms over all the datasets, I
--- observed the following regarding a possible "learning curve"
--- effect due to increasing the size of the training set:

--- (1) on some datasets error is reduced, i.e., some show a learning curve
 (2) on most datasets error is reduced, i.e., most show a learning curve
--- (3) on all datasets error is reduced, i.e., all show a learning curve
--- (4) error was basically unchanged, i.e., no learning curve
--- (5) Decision Trees are better than Nearest Neighbour learning algorithms 

*** Part 2:
--- Looking at the results for BOTH the Nearest Neighbour and
--- Decision Tree learning algorithms on error reduction relative to default
--- as the size of the training set is increased , it appears that:

 (1) there can be exceptions to a general pattern of error reduction that may reflect some properties of the dataset
--- (2) if a learning algorithm does not reduce error then there is a problem with the algorithm
--- (3) any learning learning algorithm will reduce error, given enough data
--- (4) any learning learning algorithm will reduce error, given enough time

*** Question 1(b) [4 marks]
--- First, insert your error reduction numbers in the table below (refer to
--- the assignment notebook for details on how to calculate these).
--- In particular, in each of the 4 cells in the table, substitute
--- the respective numbers you calculated for the phrase "My number".
--- PLEASE ENSURE YOU DO NOT MODIFY ANY OTHER PART OF THE TABLE ! 
--- The completed table is worth 2 marks.

********************************************************************************
***                 Mean error reduction relative to default
********************************************************************************

*** Nearest Neighbour      30.02              48.11      
*** Decision Tree          42.09              67.47      
********************************************************************************

--- The rest of this question has two multiple-choice parts, each worth 1 mark.

*** Part 1:
--- Comparing the Nearest Neighbour and Decision Tree learning
--- algorithms based on your numbers on mean error reduction
--- relative to default on only 10% of the data I observe that:

 (1) 10% of the data is not enough for learning a good model
--- (2) only the Decision Tree learner reduces error with 10% of the data
--- (3) only the Nearest Neighbour learner reduces error with 10% of the data
--- (4) both algorithms learn models that reduce error by more than 20% with 10% of the data

*** Part 2:
--- From my knowledge of how the Nearest Neighbour and Decision Tree
--- learning algorithms work I suggest the following explanation for
--- the results in the table:

--- (1) Decision Trees cannot reduce error enough
--- (2) Nearest Neighbour cannot reduce error enough
--- (3) Nearest Neighbour may be overfitting some of the datasets 
 (4) Decision Trees may be overfitting some of the datasets
--- (5) Deep Learning will definitely do better with less data

--------------------------------------------------------------
*** QUESTION 2
--- For this question "results" means the results you saved in "q2.out".

*** Question 2(a) [2 marks] 
--- This question has two multiple-choice parts, each worth 1 mark.

*** Part 1:
--- Looking at the results on percent accuracy for tree learning on
--- these datasets, the largest decreases in accuracy usually occurr
--- when moving from:

--- (1) zero to low levels of added noise
--- (2) low to medium levels of added noise
--- (3) medium to high levels of added noise
--- (4) zero to low or medium levels of added noise
 (5) low to medium or high levels of added noise

*** Part 2:
--- In decision tree learning, the parameter "min_samples_leaf"
--- places a lower bound on the number of training set examples that
--- can appear at any leaf of the decision tree. This data is used
--- during learning to assign a decision to that leaf, e.g., by
--- assigning the leaf to predict the majority class of the training
--- set examples at the leaf. By increasing the value of the
--- "min_samples_leaf" parameter we can expect this to:

--- (1) decrease overfitting by decreasing the number of examples at any leaf
 (2) decrease overfitting by increasing the number of examples at any leaf
--- (3) increase overfitting by decreasing the number of examples at any leaf
--- (4) increase overfitting by increasing the number of examples at any leaf

*** Question 2(b) [1 mark]
--- Looking the results on percent accuracy and value of the
--- "min_samples_leaf" returned by the search for the 50% added
--- noise condition compare to default, we can conclude that:

--- (1) on some of the data sets, parameter selection increased overfitting
 (2) on some of the data sets, parameter selection reduced overfitting
--- (3) parameter selection did not reduce overfitting on any of the data sets,
--- (4) for 50% added noise, parameter selection reduced overfitting 
--- (5) over all data sets, parameter selection reduced overfitting

--------------------------------------------------------------
*** QUESTION 3
--- For this question "results" means the results you saved in "q3.out".

*** Question 3(a) [2 marks]
--- This question has two multiple-choice parts, each worth 1 mark.

*** Part 1:
--- By applying a log transform to the class variable "median house
--- value" and comparing the RMSE to that of the regression before
--- the transform we observe in the results the following effect:

--- (1) RMSE was basically unchanged
--- (2) RMSE decreased by 2 orders of magnitude
 (3) RMSE decreased by 5 orders of magnitude
--- (4) RMSE increased slightly
--- (5) RMSE increased by 4 orders of magnitude

*** Part 2:
--- I experimented with one or two other transformations to the
--- variables but none of these changed RMSE as much as the log
--- transform to the class variable:

--- (1) True
 (2) False

*** Question 3(b) [1 mark]
--- The effect observed in the results following the log transform
--- to the class variable "median house value" can be interpreted as
--- meaning that:

--- (1) the multivariate regression problem has been regularised
--- (2) the transformed target variable has been scaled to have zero mean and unit variance
--- (3) random noise has been removed from the transformed target variable 
 (4) the transformed target variable has an approximately linear relationship with the other variables
--- (5) the transformed target variable has been assigned a uniform prior

--------------------------------------------------------------
*** QUESTION 4 [2 marks]
--- For this question "results" means the results you saved in "q4.out".
--- This question has two multiple-choice parts, each worth 1 mark.

*** Part 1:
--- From your knowledge of how text data is represented in machine
--- learning as a "bag-of-words", and referring to the
--- CountVectorizer pre-processing method in the sklearn
--- documentation, answer the following question about how we have
--- used it to transform the original text data. For this text
--- classification problem, CountVectorizer pre-processing was
--- applied to the snippet data to:

--- (1) generate the vocabulary and count the frequency of words independently for the training and test sets
--- (2) generate the vocabulary and count the frequency of words overall for the combined training and test sets
 (3) generate the vocabulary overall for the combined training and test sets, and count the frequency of words independently for the training and test sets
--- (4) generate the vocabulary independently for the training and test sets, and count the frequency of words overall for the combined training and test sets

*** Part 2:
--- Given the large numbers of words and tokens that apear in
--- typical natural language data, text classification learning
--- problems are usually very high-dimensional. Feature selection is
--- designed to improve the classification performance of machine
--- learning algorithms by reducing the number of irrelevant
--- features that could be included in a predictive model.  From
--- your results, select an explanation for the effect of feature
--- selection on the performance of Multinomial Naive Bayes on the
--- snippet classification dataset:

--- (1) Multinomial Naive Bayes is rarely used for text classification
 (2) the class-conditional probabilities for most of the words are relevant to classification 
--- (3) text classification is not possible using just the class-conditional probabilities of the words
--- (4) the prior probabilities of the class labels will dominate the the class-conditional probabilities of the words
